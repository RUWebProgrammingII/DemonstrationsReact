## Project 4
A new feature has emerged the guys at Pro Gamers need to have! They want to be able to edit your profile: name and photo. When the name and photo are successfully submitted, a toaster should be shown and the name and photo should appear in the footer of the site. These information should be stored within the Redux store.
