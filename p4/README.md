## Project 4
Now the guys from Pro Gamers really need our help! They are offering to send exclusive deals to their customers and want to provide a form to register the user to this service. We of course need to make sure the data is correct and garbage can't be sent from this form. Therefore we need to implement some form validation mechanism. We should display a toaster if the form is successfully submitted and the form should be cleared from all it's previous inputs. The component should console log the form data if the data is successfully provided.

Offer a selection of country, region and city which uses remote data. Use countryService to provide information for the country, region and cities

The data to provide is the following:
    * Full name
    * Telephone
    * Email
    * Country, region and city
    * Address
    * Submit button
