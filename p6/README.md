## Project 6
There is a new demand! Icelandic speakers are complaining that the site is only in English and want to have the site in Icelandic too. You should define a new reducer which handles language changes within the application. Localization files are stored in the /resources folder. The user should be able to toggle a button in the navigation bar which enables English or Icelandic. When the user selects a new language, the cookie should be updated so when the user refreshes the site, it will remember his option. Reducers should follow the Single-Responsibility-Principle (SRP).
