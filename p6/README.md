## Project 6
Pro Gamers are expanding! They want to offer authentication to the application, where users can sign-in with Facebook or GitHub. Whenever a user signs in with either of these third party authentication methods, information regarding the user should be stored within the Redux store. The Redux store should keep track of all currently authenticated users. All authenticated users should additionally get a unique guid as id. Also the image in the footer and name should update according to the information received from third-party authentication.
