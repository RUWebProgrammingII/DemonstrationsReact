## Project 3
We are going to expand on our project and create the NavigationBar which uses routing in the application. We are going to define three routes: News, Top 10 Games, About. The main site should be News (/). NavigationBar should have it's tests defined before implementing the component. Use dynamic links for all the items in the News section, define a dynamic route based on the id.

Also add dynamic links when a news item is pressed, it should return a detailed view.

The components Top 10 Games and About are provided.
