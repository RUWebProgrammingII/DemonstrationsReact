## Project 2
We are going to expand on our project and introduce good practices when defining components in React. The expansions is to define PropTypes for all our components who receive props. Also make use of defaultProps where they make sense. Introduce a global user within the application. It can be hard-coded for now. The App should hold on to the user.
