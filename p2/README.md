## Project 1
In this project we are going to create a simple React application for a company called Pro Gamers. Their application should include a navigation bar which contains three anchors to Top 10 Games, News and About. The initial page should be News and the other anchors are only for display because routing should NOT be implemented in this project. In the News section there should be a title, a search feature which can search through within the news and a filter depending on the category. Each news item within the list should have a title, short description and a category. The project should be structured in a modular manner. All news data are within the state of MainContent

## Project 2

### PropTypes
We are going to expand on our project and introduce good practices when defining components in React. The expansions is to define PropTypes for all our components who receive props. Also make use of defaultProps where they make sense. Introduce a global user within the application. It can be hard-coded for now. The App should hold on to the user.

### Routing
We are going to expand on our project and create the NavigationBar which uses routing in the application. We are going to define three routes: News, Top 10 Games, About. The main site should be News (/). Use dynamic links for all the items in the News section, define a dynamic route based on the id.

Also add dynamic links when a news item is pressed, it should return a detailed view.

The components Top 10 Games and About are provided.
